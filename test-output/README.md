### ci_smoke_test.pptx
Generated by `tests/test_ppt_integration_smoke.py` during CI runs and local testing.

**Contents:**
- 5 slides demonstrating various slide types
- Title slide with presentation metadata
- Content slides with bullet points
- Image slides with placeholder fallback (when images are unavailable)
- Summary slide

**Purpose:**
- Smoke test for PPT generation pipeline
- Visual validation of placeholder handling
- CI artifact for manual inspection

**How to regenerate:**
```bash
pytest tests/test_ppt_integration_smoke.py -v
```

## CI Integration

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) automatically:
1. Runs all tests including the smoke test
2. Generates the PPTX artifact
3. Uploads it as a GitHub Actions artifact named `pptx-smoke-test-{python-version}`

**To download from GitHub:**
1. Go to Actions tab in the repository
2. Select a workflow run
3. Download the `pptx-smoke-test-*` artifact
4. Extract and open the PPTX file

## What to Look For

When manually inspecting `ci_smoke_test.pptx`:

✅ **Expected:**
- Professional 16:9 layout
- Properly centered titles
- Clean bullet formatting
- Placeholder shapes/images for missing images (slides 3 and 4)
- Consistent styling across all slides

❌ **Issues to report:**
- Overlapping text and images
- Misaligned titles
- Missing placeholders
- Broken layouts
- Inconsistent fonts or colors

## Telemetry Data

To collect image selection telemetry during testing:

```bash
export AURORA_SELECTION_LOG=/tmp/selection_log.csv
export AURORA_SELECTION_LOG_APPEND=1
pytest tests/ -v
cat /tmp/selection_log.csv
```

The CSV will contain:
- timestamp
- lesson_id
- requested_text
- image_index
- tfidf_score
- legacy_score
- combined_score
- selected (1 or 0)

Use this data to tune `AURORA_TFIDF_WEIGHT` and `AURORA_LEGACY_WEIGHT` for better image selection.
